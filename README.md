# Analyzing-the-Adult-Census-Income-Dataset-
## This project focused on the "Adult Census Income" dataset from the 1994 US Census, obtained from Kaggle. After conducting data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, various machine learning algorithms were applied to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year. The algorithms used included logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest. Through these methods, the project aimed to develop a predictive model that could accurately classify individuals based on their attributes and income level. The results and performance of each algorithm were evaluated to determine the most effective approach for income prediction.
